We must arise and start walking back to the Father. It is never late to return to Father. This young man left his job immediately when he remembered how much abundance he has in his father's home. He did not listen to anyone. Probably others may have advised him that you are already starving and it is not a good idea to leave this job now. They must have told him that hardly you could this one little job on which your survival hangs at this moment and why you would leave this job. They must have told him that you are not alone in this famine, there are so many like you so don't try to go now. But his eyes are now opened, he has found out all the lies he is being told, he has found out his own foolishness and now he is resolved to go back to his fathers home.\r\n\r\nAnd we also see here fathers heart constantly longing for his lost son. He must have waited there on a daily basis. Any glimpse of his son returning was this father's daily longing. And one day he found that there is a figure like his son walking toward home. He knew that it was his son. This father's longing heart filled with joy. Son was still a great way off since father saw him. He saw his son, he was there in his skin and bones. So unrecognizable, dark skin and stinking. Father's heart got filled with compassion, he could not contain it. Father ran toward his son, didn't care about anything. He didn't care about how fool he would look. He didn't care about his clean clothes. He didn't care about his status. He ran toward his son and fell on his neck. What could have been expected to be done from son we see now being done by his father. He almost fell on his neck and kissed him. This son was stinking from top to bottom but the father didn't care about it. He kissed his son. Father's heart is filled with joy which can not be described.\r\n\r\nSuch is our savior too. He didn't care about his heavenly status and glory. He ran toward us, he died for us on the cross. He gave Himself up so fully.

Pardon me of all my sins and save from relying on my own wisdom. save me from all the entanglements fo the worldly joy which is so short-lived living my soul hungry and thirsty.
